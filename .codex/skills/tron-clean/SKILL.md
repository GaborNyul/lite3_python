# TRON Repo Cleanup

Use this skill to clean build artifacts and caches before committing.

## Cleanup Steps
Run the following commands from the repo root:

```bash
make -C tron_lib clean
rm -rf .venv .pytest_cache tron.egg-info build dist __pycache__ tron/__pycache__ tests/__pycache__ examples/__pycache__ .mypy_cache .ruff_cache
rm -f tron/_tron.*.so
```

## Notes
- The extension binary is generated by `uv pip install -e .`.
- The `tron_lib/` clean target removes `obj/` and `build/`.
